Over time, E-commerce has eclipsed in-store retail in terms of popularity amongst consumers and competitive prices. This has only become more prevalent due to the Covid-19 pandemic, where many stores have had to close for long periods of time. This means that more and more people have started shopping online, and online retailers have started offering a greater variety of products.

However, this has also created work for consumers, who must constantly check a multitude of product webpages to track the prices of products they are interested in. 

PriceStalker aims to provide an effecient and elegant solution to this problem by providing an intuitive interface to manage multiple product links and get notified when an item you are interested in goes on sale.
